- Welcome to my profile, thanks for the interest of reaching me here
- I'm a 25-yo brazilian, former entrepreneur, which took a little break in my career to dedicate exclusively in software developement
- I'm currently focusing my energies to masterize the so called "back-end" languages, but my focuses are web3 and data science
- In this environment I seek to form bonds with ambitious developers and all kinds of people of dev environment, I think that growth isn't a lone path
- Fell totally free to send me a message on my Twitter account, I'd love to create strong and mutual bonds
